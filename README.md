# Skaler

**Skaler** is a lightweight Python library built for **horizontal scaling of HTTP requests** through smart **API key rotation**, **proxy rotation**, and **rate-limit avoidance**.

It lets you scale effortlessly across multiple identities — so you don’t get throttled, blocked, or banned. Just fire off your requests — Skaler handles the rest.
